        <LegalSection title="1. Service description">
          Rutzo is an online gaming platform that allows users to compete with each other using NFTs as virtual cards.
          Users, referred to as "players", participate in matches where the goal is to win cards from the opponent. Each
          player must have at least 3 cards to play. The platform also includes a marketplace where players can buy,
          sell, and trade NFTs. Rutzo is not responsible for the content of the NFTs, as they are created and managed by
          third-party developers. The platform is not responsible for the value of the NFTs, as they are determined by
          the market. Rutzo is not responsible for the outcome of the matches, as they are determined by the players'
          strategies and the cards they own. Rutzo is not responsible for the outcome of the transactions in the
          marketplace, as they are determined by the players' decisions. Rutzo is not responsible for the outcome of the
          transactions in the marketplace, as they are determined by the players' decisions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Rutzo is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, dealer, financial institution, payments processor, money
          services business, or creditor. Rutzo provides a peer-to-peer web3 service that helps users play with NFTs as
          cards available on our marketplace. We do not execute or effectuate purchases, transfers, or sales of NFTs. To
          use our Service, you must use a third-party wallet compatible with the Vara cryptocurrency and connected to
          the Vara Network, which allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains.
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="2. Age and parental permission">
          Players must be at least 13 years old to use Rutzo. If you are under 18, you need the explicit permission of
          your parents or legal guardians to participate in the game and operate cryptocurrency wallets.
          <br />
          We emphasize that Rutzo disclaims any responsibility related to unauthorized use by minors. It is crucial to
          understand that parents or guardians assume the responsibility of supervising and monitoring the activities of
          minors on Rutzo. This includes overseeing their interaction with the game, their engagement with NFTs, and
          their use of cryptocurrency wallets.
          <br />
          We strongly advise parents and legal guardians to actively participate in and be aware of their minor's Rutzo
          experience. As a responsible gaming platform, Rutzo values the well-being of its users, particularly minors,
          and encourages a supportive and secure gaming environment.
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="3. Use of NFTs and Virtual Cards">
          In Rutzo, the gaming experience revolves around the utilization of virtual cards, which are represented as
          NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). These NFTs bring a unique and irreplaceable quality to each card within the game.
          <br />
          By actively participating in Rutzo, you explicitly agree that the cards won or lost in matches are considered
          virtual and non-transferable property. This virtual ownership signifies that these cards exist solely within
          the Rutzo gaming ecosystem and cannot be transferred or replicated outside of the platform.
          <br />
          Rutzo, as the platform provider, reserves the right to make modifications or removals of virtual cards when
          deemed necessary to maintain the integrity and fairness of the game. Such actions may be taken to address
          issues such as system enhancements, adjustments in game dynamics, or the rectification of any discrepancies
          that may arise during gameplay.
          <br />
          This commitment to maintaining game integrity underscores Rutzo's dedication to providing a secure, enjoyable,
          and equitable gaming environment for all participants. Players can trust that Rutzo will take appropriate
          measures to ensure the continued integrity of the virtual card system, promoting fair play and a positive user
          experience.
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="4. Matches and results">
          In the dynamic world of Rutzo, the outcome of matches holds a significant impact on the virtual card
          possessions of the players.
          <br />
          When a player faces defeat in a match, the consequence is the loss of a card. Conversely, triumphing in a
          match rewards the victorious player with the acquisition of a card from their opponent. This card exchange
          mechanism adds a strategic layer to gameplay, where players must carefully consider their moves and tactics to
          secure a favorable outcome.
          <br />
          In instances of a tie, where neither player emerges as the clear victor, Rutzo has designed the system so that
          neither participant will experience a gain or loss of cards. This approach ensures a balanced and impartial
          resolution to matches that end in a draw.
          <br />
          Rutzo's commitment to fairness extends beyond individual matches. The platform diligently strives to create
          and maintain a gaming environment that is fair, transparent, and equitable for all participants. This includes
          continuous monitoring of game mechanics, periodic evaluations, and proactive measures to address any emerging
          concerns that may affect the balance and enjoyment of the Rutzo gaming experience.
          <br />
          Players can engage in Rutzo with confidence, knowing that the platform is dedicated to fostering a competitive
          yet fair atmosphere, where outcomes are determined by skill and strategy rather than external factors.
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="5. Financial Responsibility and In-Game Purchases">
          In the Rutzo gaming universe, financial transactions play a pivotal role in enhancing the gaming experience,
          and players must navigate these transactions responsibly.
          <br />
          Players bear the responsibility for all financial transactions made on Rutzo, which includes in-game
          purchases. It is essential to recognize that the virtual assets, enhancements, or services acquired through
          these transactions contribute to the overall enjoyment and progression within the Rutzo platform.
          <br />
          To ensure a secure and enjoyable gaming journey, Rutzo places a strong emphasis on player accountability. As
          such, we disclaim any liability for unauthorized purchases made on player accounts. We encourage players to
          adopt stringent security measures, such as safeguarding their account credentials and employing two-factor
          authentication, to fortify the protection of their accounts and sensitive data.
          <br />
          Rutzo acknowledges the evolving nature of online gaming environments and remains committed to implementing
          robust security measures to safeguard player information. Nevertheless, players play a crucial role in
          maintaining the security of their accounts by being vigilant and proactive in adopting recommended security
          practices.
          <br />
          Our goal is to provide an immersive and secure gaming environment, and we appreciate the cooperation of
          players in upholding the financial responsibility integral to their Rutzo experience. Together, we contribute
          to creating a gaming community built on trust, responsibility, and shared enjoyment.
